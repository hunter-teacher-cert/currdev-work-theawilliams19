##Name of the tool: 
Google CS First

##General purpose:
Block-Based Integrated Development Environment


##Class I use it in: 
Grade 4


##How I use it in class: 

computer science projects integrated into other subject areas (e.g., SEL/Indentity Work, Social Justice work, etc.)


##Why I have selected that tool for that purpose:
I like the user-interface. I find that the UI is very user-friendly for elementary students. I also really like the lay out of the tutorial videos. They are well organized and accessible. Additionally, I like that starter project code is offered for each project. From the teacher end I like the dashboard that organizes student work. I also like that the account creation process is streamlined. A class can easily be imported from Google Classroom. Also, students can easily log-in using Google SSO & their @nycstudents.net accounts.
