#### Concept: Networks and Systems Design
#### Sub-concept: Networks and the Internet
#### Standard: 4-6.NSD.4 - Model how data is structured to transmit through a network.
##### *This lesson activity is based on one I participated in during an SEP Jr. PD session.

#### Lesson/Task/Assignment Description: 
Students will work in groups of 4-6 students to create a message, either text or an image. If text, students will brainstorm a message they might text message a friend/family member. They can write letters seperately each on a post-it and put each post it in an envelope. If an image, students will draw a message on a large piece of chart paper and then cut it into pieces. Again, they would put each cut up part of the image into an envelope. The teacher will explain that this phase is the decomposition of the data that happens before it is transmitted through the Internet. Students will then trade packets (envelopes) with another group. One students will be the device from which the data is being sent. Another student will be the destination device receiving the data. The remaining students will then have a kind of relay race to transmit the packets (envelopes) of information to it's final destination. These students will have to run back and forth delivering one packet of data at a time. The student device receiving the data will have to reconstruct the data into the intended message or image. The focus of this standard is on understanding that data is broken down into smaller pieces and labeled to travel through a network and reassembled. This physical and tactile activity will help students to gain this understanding.

#### Lesson/Task/Assignment Description: 
The focus of this standard is on using ciphers to encrypt and decrypt messages as a means of safeguarding data. Google CS First has a great unplugged activity titled " Send a secret message" that I used with my students last year for CS Ed Week/Hour of Code to teach my students about encryption and decryption. In this activity, students will use a shift cipher to decrypt a message and then create a cipher wheel and use it to encrypt their own secret message, then send it to a friend to see if they can decrypt it.
