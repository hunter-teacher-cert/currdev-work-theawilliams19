### NEW COURSE DESCRIPTION
I would like to create a course for grade 4 and/or 5 which focuses on social justice across the curriculum. This year I will doing a data science/Python pilot through CS4All in which I will help my students use Python to create data visualizations. I am hoping that I will be able to build on this experience to design a course that ties in with various content area units of study like math, social studies and writing. I would like students to learn about real life social justice issues in the world, use Phython to make sense of real-world data and also using either Python or another progrmaming language to create programs as solution prototypes or PSAs to share their advocacy work with a broader, real-world audience.

### TARGET AUDIENCE
Grade 4/5 - upper elementary, but could also be used with middle school

### Where it fits along with the other courses in your school:
I will like to do a full audit/evaluation of all content curriculum to see where connections could be made for this social justice focused project. This project could potentially tie in with math, reading, writing, science or social studies. The biggest hurdle will be administrator buy-in and careful review of compliance restrictions in order to see where flexibility lies in order to make time and space for this work. Other content area lessons may have to be cut and/or merged in order for this year-long project to be incorporated. Content curriculum breadth will have to be sacrificed for depth.
