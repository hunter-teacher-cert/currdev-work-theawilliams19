# Lesson 1 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Frontload Vocabulary** 
Read Chapter 1 of “Power On” book by: Jean J. Ryoo and Jane Margolis
Interactive Vocabulary Game

Have vocabulary words in a bowl and each partnership picks 1 term.
Students work in partnerships (driver/navigator) to complete the Animate a Name activity on Scratch for one of the terms and include the definition for the word in their own words.
Students  jigsaw share out their definition

#### Key Terms and Definitions

**Algorithm**
A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations especially by a computer

**Artificial Intelligence**
The ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with human beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing
systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

**Bias** 
*Prejudice* 
in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.

**Ethnicity**
While this is a contested term among anthropologists, sociologists, and others, this generally refers to identification based on shared culture, where people live, language(s)
spoken, etc.

**Identity**
How one defines oneself in relation to qualities, beliefs, cultural practices, and more. This may or may not be defined according to racial/ethnic identity, gender identity, family
origins, etc.

**Latinx**
Refers to the ethnicity of people who are from or have a background in a Latin American country. Since “Latino” is a masculine adjective in the Spanish language and does not give
visibility to those who do not identify as men, the term “Latinx” was created with the intention to be inclusive of all gender identities.

**Nationality**
A legal identification of a person in international law, establishing the person as a subject,
a national, of a sovereign state. It affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords
the person the protection of the state against other states.

**Race**
A social construct that is not rooted in science, but has been created by humans to
identify groups based on shared physical characteristics. Race does not clearly delineate
identification based on ancestry, heritage culture, etc.

**Racism**
A system that gives power to some and oppresses others based on race. It is the result of
social and institutional powers working in tandem with racial prejudice. There are different
forms of racism, for example interpersonal, internalized, institutional, and structural to
name a few. Interpersonal racism occurs between individuals. Internalized racism is when
people apply the system of power and oppression to oneself, resulting in self-hatred and
believing that one deserves to be disadvantaged. Institutional racism refers to how
policies and practices either within or across institutions favor a specific group and
disadvantages others. Structural racism involves a system of institutional practices, public
policies, and belief systems creating structures of power for some and oppression for
others.

**Racist**
Actions, measures, ideas, policies, etc. that produce and sustain that one racial group is
superior to another racial group, thereby supporting systems of power and oppression that
elevate some and oppress all others.



**Early Finishers:**
Sketch their character sprite plan

# Lesson 2 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Character Analysis**
During 2nd reading of Chapter 2
Students in heterogeneous groups discuss 1 character in the book, and create a social media profile for the character on poster/chart paper (add a post-it with a ? for unknown sections about the character).
Gallery walk students share feedback (and if possible add a post-it with answers for ?)
Independent work - students create a sprite for the character (to have for future use)


1. Where is the setting of this story?
2. What are Antonio's parents fighting about?
3. What are Antonio and Taylor going to miss about not being at the same school with Christine?
4. Why did the newsfeed make Antonio upset?
5. What is Artificial Intelligence? What are some characteristics that artificial intelligence can learn?
6. What is an algorithm?


Turn and Talk: Joy Buolamwini what was the issue that this person discovered in her research? What did she have to do in order for her computer to recognize her?

12. Highlight the stats in the text Discussion: Impressions Thoughts and Questions
The percentage of the Black and Latinx workforce in comparison to the Black and Latinx population in California:
 7% workforce vs 39% (Latinx) + 6% (Black) population 
Only 26% of the professional computing occupations are held by women, even though women make up 50% of the population. Of the 26% women in tech 7% Asian, 3% African American, 2% Latina 
Only 3% of students that are enrolled in Computer Science courses in the state of California 


Describe the four main characters in this graphic novel. What do we know about each character so far?

# Lesson 3 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Read Chapter 5** 

**Re-read and stop for discussion:** 
Purpose for reading: As we re-read think about: the obstacles to accessing CS ed discussed 


The CS pioneers we are introduced to
1. On page 72, the friends are discussing how their teachers address or ignore race/ethnicity in the classroom. Why is it important to address race/ethnicity in school settings? What do you wish teachers would discuss in relation to race/ethnicity?
2. On page 73, the group talks about barriers to computer science education. Can you think of other ways computer science may not be accessible?
3. On page 76, the friends are discussing how a lack of access led to a disparity for Black swimmers. Then friends joke about Christine pursuing diving because she is half Korean, and also discuss the stereotypes that shaped Taylor’s family’s experience with swimming.  How do you think this is relevant to computer science education and careers in technology?


**Think-Pair-Share:**
In this chapter, we learned about many different figures in computer science. Which person did you most relate to or stood out to you? Why? 
What obstacles did they face?

[**Pioneer Calendar:**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19vLOICQqDf-3cWWtFeWkOlnPnTyBXPDAhetw7M_AKto/edit?usp=sharing)
Students work in pairs to explore one month of the calendar.
Share out about the pioneers for that month.
