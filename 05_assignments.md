####Key Terms and Definitions

_Algorithm_ 
A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations especially by a computer
_Artificial Intelligence_
The ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with human beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing
systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.
_Bias_ 
*Prejudice* 
in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.
*Ethnicity*
While this is a contested term among anthropologists, sociologists, and others, this generally refers to identification based on shared culture, where people live, language(s)
spoken, etc.
*Identity*
How one defines oneself in relation to qualities, beliefs, cultural practices, and more. This may or may not be defined according to racial/ethnic identity, gender identity, family
origins, etc.
*Latinx*
Refers to the ethnicity of people who are from or have a background in a Latin American country. Since “Latino” is a masculine adjective in the Spanish language and does not give
visibility to those who do not identify as men, the term “Latinx” was created with the intention to be inclusive of all gender identities.
*Nationality*
A legal identification of a person in international law, establishing the person as a subject,
a national, of a sovereign state. It affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords
the person the protection of the state against other states.
*Race*
A social construct that is not rooted in science, but has been created by humans to
identify groups based on shared physical characteristics. Race does not clearly delineate
identification based on ancestry, heritage culture, etc.
*Racism*
A system that gives power to some and oppresses others based on race. It is the result of
social and institutional powers working in tandem with racial prejudice. There are different
forms of racism, for example interpersonal, internalized, institutional, and structural to
name a few. Interpersonal racism occurs between individuals. Internalized racism is when
people apply the system of power and oppression to oneself, resulting in self-hatred and
believing that one deserves to be disadvantaged. Institutional racism refers to how
policies and practices either within or across institutions favor a specific group and
disadvantages others. Structural racism involves a system of institutional practices, public
policies, and belief systems creating structures of power for some and oppression for
others.
*Racist*
Actions, measures, ideas, policies, etc. that produce and sustain that one racial group is
superior to another racial group, thereby supporting systems of power and oppression that
elevate some and oppress all others.
