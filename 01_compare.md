##ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
Focus on the following:
Major differences
Major similiarities
Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

###Curriciculums being compared: Grade 4 Code.org and Codespark

###Major differences:
Codespark does not parse out their course into grade levels like Code.org. It is intended for a K-5 audience. It also does not have any text included on the coding blocks. Code.org includes and starts with digital citizenship lessons, Codespark does not include any lessons on digital citizenship. Codespark also does not include lessons on functions or go into nested loops. Also, the Codespark is much more immersive, like a video game. The area to build your program is at the bottom of the screen and takes up a small portion of the screen while the stage area where your program runs is much larger and prominent, while Code.org's stage is much smaller, with a larger programming area and set up side by side, more like some of the text-based IDE's we have used (e.g., Repl.it). Additionally, Codespark programs are triggered by pressing or clicking on the characters/sprites (objects) you have written programs for, whereas Code.org has a more traditional "run" button.

###Major similiarities

Although Code.org calls their curriculum CS fundamentals and Codespark calls their curriculum Intro to CS, the content is similar in focusing on some of the basic concepts students need to know when beginning to learn programming. The content of Codespark
Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
