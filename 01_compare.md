### ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
Focus on the following:
Major differences
Major similiarities
Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

### Curriciculums being compared:
Grade 4 Code.org and Codespark

### Major differences:
Codespark does not parse out their course into grade levels like Code.org. It is intended for a K-5 audience. It also does not have any text included on the coding blocks. Code.org includes and starts with digital citizenship lessons and includes lessons on the impacts of computing. Codespark does not include any lessons on either of these topics. Codespark also does not include lessons on functions and although covers loops, it does not go into nested loops. Codespark has a heavier focus on sequencing and also includes lessons on decomposition, debugging, events, stacks and queues. Also, the Codespark interface is much more immersive, like a video game. The area to build your program is at the bottom of the screen and takes up a small portion of the screen while the stage area where your program runs is much larger and prominent, while Code.org's stage is much smaller, with a larger programming area and set up side by side, more like some of the text-based IDE's we have used (e.g., Repl.it). Additionally, Codespark programs are triggered by pressing or clicking on the characters/sprites (objects) you have written programs for, whereas Code.org has a more traditional "run" button. Furthermore, the Codespark curriculum does not include a final project. The Codespark curriculum comes with pre-created student-facing Google slide decks that can be used to teach with as well as more traditional teacher/admin facing lesson plans, whereas Code.org only has the latter and not the former (slide decks).

### Major similiarities
Although Code.org calls their curriculum CS fundamentals and Codespark calls their curriculum Intro to CS, the content is similar in focusing on some of the basic concepts students need to know when beginning to learn programming. They both using block-based coding, although as mentioned above, Codespark's code blocks have no text. They both include a dashboard to monitor student progress and both courses cover the following topics: loops and conditionals. 

### Comparative streangths & weaknesses
(That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem equally good then no need to comment).
I think one of Codespark's major strength's is that is gamified and therefore would be more motivating/engaging for students. I do like that Code.org covers digital citizenship and impacts of computing, which are often left out of computer science curriculums, but as we learned through our standards exploration, are important topics to include. I think another strength of Codespark is the removal of text from the coding blocks, which lowers the barrier to entry as far as student's requiring literacy skills. I like Code.org's culminating project as it gives students more opportunity for choice as opposed to puzzle-based activities which an be more limiting. The student progress monitoring is really useful to have on both. I really appreciate having teacher-created slide decks, as these can be modified and cut down on time spent creating mateirals from scratch.

### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
I would like to use both these curriculums in their entirety as they afford me the ability to better differentiate for my students. Codespark offers me a resource that can better hook more hesitant students into computer science. I like that both curriculums have a slightly different approach to CS fundamentals and therefore would cover a range of topics for my students, especially those with less exposure and practice. I think having the fundamentals in different formats will hopefully help students internalize and also generalize these concepts in order to apply them to projects of their own design later in the school year.
